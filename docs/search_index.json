[["index.html", "Field Operations Safety Manual UC Field Operations Manual Copyright Notice", " Field Operations Safety Manual University of California, Office of the President 2022-03-04 UC Field Operations Manual This manual provides guidelines and resources to lead safe, successful field courses and research trips. The content focuses on risk management issues that are relevant for California-based field courses and research, international trips, research expeditions, and other outdoor excursions. Field sites may include field stations, natural reserves, public lands or parks, wilderness areas, coastline or waterways, or more controlled sites such as construction areas, excavations, or mines. The Field Operations Manual was developed to serve as a reference document and teaching tool as well as to highlight applicable UC policies and State/Federal laws. The manual is organized into key sections on planning, training, incident response, best practices for trip leaders, and appendices on common field hazards and local campus resources. Integration of field safety planning into routine instruction and training will meet key objectives and regulatory requirements of your Campus or Departments Injury and Illness Prevention Plan (IIPP). The IIPP is a written safety program to protect employees from illnesses and injuries per the California Code of Regulations Title 8, Section 3203, by establishing a safety management framework for identifying and correcting workplace hazards, ensuring employee training and compliance, and communicating information related to safety and health issues. Faculty, staff and students, including student employees and volunteers, are accountable for health and safety rules and following safe work practices, including: obtaining appropriate training for designated activities using personal protective equipment (PPE) and safety equipment as required and directed, reporting unsafe conditions, malfunctioning equipment, and other safety concerns, reporting all injuries and incidents, and understanding what to do in the event of an emergency.

"],["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Risk, and recognizing the possibility of loss or injury, is integral to experiential learning and is inherent in field environments where we teach and conduct research. A field instructor or researcher must also be an effective risk manager who understands and anticipates risks and acts appropriately to reduce the likelihood of negative consequences. Accidents often result from a combination of challenging conditions, inadequate preparation and poor communication. For this reason, an effective trip leader must incorporate many attributes of leadership including preparation, competency, effective communication, appropriate judgment, self and group awareness, and tolerance for adversity and uncertainty (adapted from the National Outdoor Leadership School Educator Notebook).

The field hazard assessment tool below provides an overview of resources and hazard mitigation steps for common UC field activities. All fieldwork warrants a pre-trip discussion regarding foreseen hazards, appropriate precautions, communication options, and emergency procedures. Additional actions are listed below. Label the heading: # Hello world {#nice-label}. Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter . If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: . 1.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2021) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key.

If youd like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 5.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your books title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your books source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapters source file.
