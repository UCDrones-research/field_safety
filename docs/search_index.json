[["index.html", "Field Operations Safety Manual UC Field Operations Manual Copyright Notice", " Field Operations Safety Manual University of California, Office of the President 2022-04-06 UC Field Operations Manual This manual provides guidelines and resources to lead safe, successful field courses and research trips. The content focuses on risk management issues that are relevant for California-based field courses and research, international trips, research expeditions, and other outdoor excursions. Field sites may include field stations, natural reserves, public lands or parks, wilderness areas, coastline or waterways, or more controlled sites such as construction areas, excavations, or mines. The Field Operations Manual was developed to serve as a reference document and teaching tool as well as to highlight applicable UC policies and State/Federal laws. The manual is organized into key sections on planning, training, incident response, best practices for trip leaders, and appendices on common field hazards and local campus resources. Integration of field safety planning into routine instruction and training will meet key objectives and regulatory requirements of your Campus or Departments Injury and Illness Prevention Plan (IIPP). The IIPP is a written safety program to protect employees from illnesses and injuries per the California Code of Regulations Title 8, Section 3203, by establishing a safety management framework for identifying and correcting workplace hazards, ensuring employee training and compliance, and communicating information related to safety and health issues. Faculty, staff and students, including student employees and volunteers, are accountable for health and safety rules and following safe work practices, including: obtaining appropriate training for designated activities using personal protective equipment (PPE) and safety equipment as required and directed, reporting unsafe conditions, malfunctioning equipment, and other safety concerns, reporting all injuries and incidents, and understanding what to do in the event of an emergency.

"],["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Risk, and recognizing the possibility of loss or injury, is integral to experiential learning and is inherent in field environments where we teach and conduct research. A field instructor or researcher must also be an effective risk manager who understands and anticipates risks and acts appropriately to reduce the likelihood of negative consequences. Accidents often result from a combination of challenging conditions, inadequate preparation and poor communication. For this reason, an effective trip leader must incorporate many attributes of leadership including preparation, competency, effective communication, appropriate judgment, self and group awareness, and tolerance for adversity and uncertainty (adapted from the National Outdoor Leadership School Educator Notebook).

The field hazard assessment tool below provides an overview of resources and hazard mitigation steps for common UC field activities. All fieldwork warrants a pre-trip discussion regarding foreseen hazards, appropriate precautions, communication options, and emergency procedures. Additional actions are listed below. Destination Will you be traveling more than 100 miles from your home campus/office? Register with UC Away for travel insurance documentation, 24/7 assistance, and a custom Trip Brief Will you be traveling internationally? Be familiar with the UC International Activities Policy, your campus International Activities office (listed on p.13 of the Policy); the resources at ucgo.org Does your Trip Brief, the CDC, or State Department recommend vaccinations or prophylaxis for your destination? Schedule a medical visit at least 6-8 weeks prior to your trip; Occupational Health, Travel Clinic or Student Health Clinics available, depending on your campus. Will you be visiting sites with hazardous terrain, climate, wildfire, zoonotic risks, poor sanitation, other environmental hazards, or remote sites with limited services (e.g more than 30 minutes from emergency medical services)? Complete a Field Safety Plan and review with all participants. At least one participant should have current first aid training and carry a first aid kid. Does your worksite lack reliable phone service? Include check-in procedures in your Avoid working alone, when possible Carry field radios or satellite communication device Will you be visiting controlled sites such as construction sites or mines? Request PPE and site access requirements in advance Carry UC identification Avoid working alone, when possible Check-in with site manager/ superintendent to understand what other hazards are currently present on the job-site Will you be driving to your destination via UC, rental or personal vehicles? Review UC auto insurance policies for students, faculty and staff; complete relevant driver safety training as required by your campus; consider off road/4x4 training if applicable Will anyone be chartering boats, planes or using other non-commercial means of transportation? Consult with Risk Services regarding appropriate insurance precautions Participation Are you responsible for students registered in a field course? Review UC Field Ops Manual Ch.4: Best Practices for Trip Leaders and Campus Resources Will participants be camping or sleeping in shared dorms, housing, etc.? Consider establishing a Student Behavior Agreement or reviewing a Code of Conduct Consider establishing a Student Behavior Agreement or reviewing a Code of Conduct Set the tone for a safe trip by discussing expectations and rules before the trip Carry a participant roster with emergency contact information at all times Will volunteers be helping on your project? Registered volunteers formally; consult with Risk Will family members, partners, or other companions be travelling with participants? Companions should be registered via UC Away and may be eligible for UC travel benefits FIELD ACTIVITIES-Specifics to integrate into your Field Safety Plan| Working outdoors with temperatures over 80 degrees F? Complete Heat Illness Prevention training Carry sufficient water, take breaks in shade Carry shades or tarps if natural is unavailable Maintain means of communication, awareness of worksite location, and ability to obtain EMS Working in dry vegetation/areas with high fire danger? Complete fire extinguisher training Carry a fire extinguisher, shovel, and bucket of sand in your vehicle Consult with your Campus Fire Marshal or Fire Prevention Office Working in cold, possibly wet conditions? Provide all participants a recommended gear list including waterproof clothing, boots; layers for insulation, extra dry socks, tarp etc. Carry extra blankets or sleeping bag in your vehicle for emergencies Does work involve: Excavating soil more than 4 feet deep? Working at heights over 6 feet? Entering caves, vaults, mines, or other potential confined spaces? Handling or transporting hazardous materials or samples? Use of powered tools or equipment? Working in loud noise? ATVS? Snowmobiles? Contact EH&amp;S for appropriate hazard assessment, training, and PPE selection Include training requirements and precautions in your Field Safety Plan or refer to specific procedures, JHAs, etc. If medical clearance or vaccinations are required, schedule your appointment with Occupational Health at least 6-8 weeks prior to travel (e.g for use of respirators, working in loud noise, handling bats or other hazardous wildlife). 1.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.

If youd like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 5.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your books title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your books source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapters source file.
